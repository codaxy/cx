      # CSS

      Cx widgets are styled using CSS rules. By default, CSS follows these conventions:

      - Global reset rules are not part of the framework.
      Widgets should not cause any problems if combined with an existing CSS framework, e.g. Bootsrap.
      - All CSS rules are prefixed.
      - In order to make styling easy, all widgets should honor global theme variables for default colors and sizes.

      ## Conventions

      CSS rules follow a modified BEM methodology:

      0. Block element classes start with the prefix `cxb-`, e.g. `.cxb-window`.
      0. Element classes start with the prefix `cxe-` and include the parent block name, e.g. `.cxe-window-header`.
      0. Style modifiers start with the prefix `cxm-`, e.g. `.cxm-glow`.
      0. State modifiers start with the prefix `cxs-`, e.g. `.cxs-disabled`.

      ## SASS

      Cx widget code is located inside the `src/ui` directory. It's enough to import `index.scss` to your SASS project
      and all Cx styles will be pulled in. Alternatively, each widget has a corresponding SCSS file, and you may
      manually add imports for files that you actually need.
