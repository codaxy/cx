            Improve performance by detaching `PrivateStore` subtree from the rest of the page. 
            Detached contents render in their own render loop and use a `data` declaration to determine which changes can go in or out.
            Detached render loops break the use of `context`, so some advanced Cx features, such as layouts, may not work.
